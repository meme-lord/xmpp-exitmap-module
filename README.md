# xmpp-exitmap-module
Simple exitmap module that uses openssl and ssl cert comparisons to find the bad exit nodes intercepting XMPP logins, files and messages.

#Note
The command.py file on exitmap has to be swapped with the command.py module in this repo to use it. I may try make the module work more sensibly and do a pull request with it to exitmap at a later date
